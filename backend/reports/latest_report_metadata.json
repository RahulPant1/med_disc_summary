          "severity": "HIGH",
          "location": "ADVICE ON DISCHARGE - TAB. DILZEM - SR 60 MG",
          "current": "TAB. DILZEM - SR 60 MG 1 TAB. P/O 24 HOURLY (9AM) prescribed for a patient with Moderate LV Systolic Dysfunction (LVEF 40-45%).",
          "suggestion": "Reconsider Diltiazem in a patient with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are generally contraindicated or used with extreme caution in HFrEF as they can worsen cardiac function.",
          "explanation": "Diltiazem can depress myocardial contractility and exacerbate heart failure in patients with reduced ejection fraction, leading to clinical deterioration and increased morbidity and mortality."

          "location": "ADVICE ON DISCHARGE - TAB. DILZEM - SR 60 MG",
          "current": "TAB. DILZEM - SR 60 MG prescribed concurrently with TAB. ECOSPRIN AV 75/20 MG (containing Atorvastatin).",
          "suggestion": "Review drug interactions. Diltiazem is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and can significantly increase plasma concentrations of Atorvastatin. Consider an alternative calcium channel blocker, an alternative statin (e.g., Pravastatin, Rosuvastatin), or a lower dose of Atorvastatin with close monitoring.",
          "explanation": "Concurrent use of Diltiazem with Atorvastatin can lead to dangerously elevated Atorvastatin levels, increasing the risk of severe adverse effects such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis."

          "current": "TAB. DILZEM - SR 60 MG prescribed concurrently with TAB. EPTUS 25 MG (Eplerenone).",
          "suggestion": "Review drug interactions. Diltiazem is a CYP3A4 inhibitor and can increase plasma concentrations of Eplerenone. Consider an alternative blood pressure medication, or close monitoring for hyperkalemia.",
          "explanation": "Increased Eplerenone levels due to Diltiazem co-administration can lead to an elevated risk of hyperkalemia, which can be life-threatening, especially in patients with heart failure or renal impairment."

          "suggestion": "Review drug interactions. Diltiazem can increase Theophylline levels. Monitor Theophylline levels closely and adjust the dose as needed, or consider an alternative bronchodilator if Theophylline levels cannot be monitored effectively.",
          "explanation": "Elevated Theophylline levels due to interaction with Diltiazem can lead to Theophylline toxicity, characterized by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, arrhythmias, and seizures, which can be life-threatening."

          "suggestion": "Document a clear follow-up plan for the pulmonary hamartoma identified on HRCT, including further imaging (e.g., repeat CT scan in 6-12 months) or referral to a pulmonologist/thoracic surgeon for definitive management.",
          "explanation": "A pulmonary hamartoma, while typically benign, requires appropriate follow-up to confirm its nature, monitor for growth, or rule out malignancy, especially given the patient's history of 'Old Pulmonary Koch's'. Lack of a documented follow-up plan poses a risk of missed diagnosis or delayed intervention for potential complications or an alternative diagnosis."

          "current": "PULSE - 56 b/min at discharge. No documented management plan or comment on this finding.",
          "suggestion": "Document the clinical significance of discharge bradycardia (56 b/min), especially given the patient's admission tachycardia and the initiation of negative chronotropic medications like Diltiazem. Provide a management plan or specific monitoring instructions for the patient and family.",
          "explanation": "Bradycardia at discharge, particularly after an episode of tachycardia and with the initiation of rate-lowering drugs, can indicate an underlying cardiac issue or medication side effect. Lack of documented action or plan increases the risk of symptomatic bradycardia, cardiac decompensation, or drug-induced adverse events post-discharge."

          "suggestion": "Review all medications for necessity, potential for de-prescribing, and to reduce pill burden, especially considering the patient's age and multiple comorbidities.",
          "explanation": "Polypharmacy (>10 medications) in elderly patients increases the risk of adverse drug reactions, drug-drug interactions, prescribing cascades, medication non-adherence, and decreased quality of life."
